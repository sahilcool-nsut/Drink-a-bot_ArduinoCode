## About Drink-a-Bot
○ Drink-a-Bot is a smart drink dispenser that can move around and serve drinks using a dispenser system. 

○ Drink filling/refilling is one of the most repetitive demands in any restaurant or catering service. We aim to tackle the lack of efficiency encountered in human settings in this domain.

○ The main motivation for Drink-a-Bot comes from the urge to increase waiter automation in a smart manner.

○ It can be controlled remotely within a radius of 10 meters using the cross-platform app we made using flutter.

○ The prototype shall bridge the gap between the currently existing systems (totally manual) and totally autonomous robot restaurants.
